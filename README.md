# Introduction
In this project, I have created a prototype of the Snake and Ladder game using Vue.js. The final file with the completed work is there in the boardgame.html. The files, vueX.html (X is a number 0-7) are used for incremental steps towards building the final updated version.

## Documentation
I have included all the documentation in the html file as a comment above the \<body\> element.
